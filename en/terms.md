## 1\. Scope of the provisions

1\.1 These general terms and conditions cover the use of the services provided by S&P HEALTHCARE SERVICES, Cornelia Toussaint, Dohnaer Stra&szlig;e 73, 01219 Dresden, (subsequently referred to as: “S&P” or “contractor”). They govern the conclusion of a contract between the company, which makes use of the services offered (“client”) and S&P and the execution of contracts agreed; they also inform both parties of their respective mutual rights and obligations under the contract.

1\.2 The business relationship between S&P and the client is regulated exclusively by these General terms and conditions together with the data privacy regulations and the terms agreed by S&P and the client for each “individual order”. In cases of doubt, these individual terms have priority over the General terms and conditions. S&P does not accept any deviating conditions imposed by the client, unless they have given their express (written) agreement to them.

1\.3 S&P can alter these General terms and conditions at any time with effect for the future. In such a case, S&P will inform the client of the changed conditions and highlight the changes clearly. If the client is not in agreement with these changes, he can object to them within four weeks of receipt of the notification of change. Should the client not lodge any objection within this period, the client has accepted the changes. If the client should object to the changes, the contract will remain in force, but S&P may make use of its ordinary right of termination. S&P will inform the client of their right of objection, the meaning of the behaviour of the client and the resulting legal consequences separately in the communication.

## 2\. General specification of services

2\.1. S&P provides clients in a range of sectors including the pharmaceutical sector with contact to doctors in practices and clinics (“doctors”) and/or pharmacists through Health Care Representatives (“HCR”). S&P organizes the visits from HCRs on the basis of the address information provided by the client and informs the client of the discussions held in the scope agreed with the client. The client will provide the specialist information material for the visits by the HCRs and any unsellable samples (“samples”) to be submitted to S&P free of charge.

2\.2. S&P may not perform the tasks with which they have been commissioned by the client without the permission of third parties. These third parties are not the HCRs. The client is aware and is in agreement to the fact that the HCRs are employed in a freelance capacity and not by S&P.

## 3\. Prices and payment

3\.1. The prices charged by S&P for their services are calculated on the basis of the scope of the services required by the client. The services are arranged individually between the parties and recorded in a separate agreement (individual order, see point 4 for further information).

3\.2. The payments to be made for the services agreed are due after the issue of an invoice as follows: 1/3 before the start of the project – 1/3 after elapse of half of the project duration – 1/3 upon completion of the project. S&P will place invoices with sales tax added.

3\.3. Any costs incurred by the participation of the HCR in the information events (“Train the Trainer” or others) are to be borne by the client.

## 4\. Conclusion of the contract, individual orders, duration of the contract, termination

4\.1. S&P and the client will establish the exact scope of the desired service and their costs as well as the duration of the contract in an individual order. The respective contact partners of the client and S&P for pharmaceutical and technical matters are recorded in the individual order.

4\.2. The contractual relationship between S&P and the client begins once the individual order for which these General terms and conditions apply, has been signed.

4\.3. The start and duration of the commissioned performance is defined by the agreements concluded within the relevant individual order.

4\.4. The duration of the contract is defined by the term of the booked services selected by the client and recorded in the individual order, supplemented by any contractual obligations still to be performed by the parties to the agreement after the end of the duration of the agreement.

4\.5. The agreement will end with the successful communication of all information to the client or with the last payment to S&P, whichever of the two is the later event.

4\.6. S&P can take advantage of its ordinary right of termination with a deadline of 4 (four) weeks to the end of the month, in cases where a client has objected to the receipt of the notification of changes in accordance figure 1.3. Otherwise, the parties cannot make use of ordinary termination.

4\.7. The legal right to termination of this agreement on grounds of good cause with a shorter or even no deadline remains unaffected. Good cause includes for example:

4\.7.1. If the client is in arrears with the payment of due fees.

4\.7.2. If one or both of the parties infringes applicable law or these general terms and conditions, especially specifications pertaining to data protection and other expressly agreed obligations.

4\.8. The termination must be issued in writing (e-mail is sufficient).

4\.9. The consequences of the termination:

4\.9.1. Once the termination has taken force, both parties are no longer required to perform the contractual services, unless an express agreement to the contrary has been entered or this results from the nature of the service or agreement.

4\.9.2. The client is required to remunerate any services performed by S&P up to the point at which the termination takes effect and which have not yet been remunerated.

4\.9.3. S&P will submit all information collected up to the point of the termination and not yet made available to the client pertaining to visits to the doctors and pharmacies within 6 (six) weeks, together with the information documentation and samples in the possession of S&P.

The client is obliged to inform S&P about the “DHCP letter” immediately. If this involves notification of previously unknown and/or more serious side effects, S&P will cease the provision of services for the applicable product immediately after learning of these developments; if this agreement covers further products not affected by the DHCP letter, its provisions retain their validity. In such cases, S&P is entitled to complete payment for the whole service pertaining to the corresponding product(s) as foreseen in the individual order without the client acquiring the right to require S&P to perform the foreseen service.

## 5\. Grant of rights

S&P grants the client the right to the simple, transferable, time-restricted and spatially unrestricted usage rights of the results of its activities within the scope of this agreement. The concession is covered by the remuneration agreed; S&P does not have separate claim for remuneration.

## 6\. The obligations of S&P

6\.1. S&P will only commission an HCR with the requisite specialist knowledge to perform the service, in accordance with &sect; 75 section 2 AMG.

If the client learns of information during the duration of the contract that would have an influence on the information provided by S&P to the doctor / pharmacist, he is responsible for communicating this to S&P immediately. If necessary, he is to provide S&P with the altered information material; any costs incurred will be borne by the client. The same applies to the samples.

The details will be determined in a separate written agreement between S&P and the client.

7\.5. The client is obliged to inform S&P in writing immediately (e-mail or fax is sufficient) as soon as he has been informed by the higher federal authority (*Bundesoberbehörde*) responsible for the drug (BfArM or Paul-Ehrlich Institut) if a DHCP letter is to be sent due to previously unknown and/or serious side effects from a product supervised by S&P within the scope of this agreement (see fig. 4.10.).

This includes discharge from all legal or court costs incurred by S&P in conjunction with a defence against such claims. This discharge also applies to claims from third parties against S&P or the HCRs due to culpable infringement of legal specifications which result from the use of information and / or samples provided by the client.
